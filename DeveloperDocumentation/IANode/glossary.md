### ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
A security model that controls access to resources based on attributes (such as user roles, location, time, and device type). It enables dynamic, fine-grained access management to enhance security and compliance.

### Apache Jena
An open-source Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. It provides tools to handle RDF data, SPARQL queries, and ontology-based reasoning.

### Apache Kafka
A distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and event-driven applications, supporting high-throughput messaging.

### Digital Twin
A virtual model of an object, system, or process, connected to its real-world counterpart through a two-way flow of right-time data. This allows for testing decisions and understanding the impact of actions while ensuring the real-world counterpart remains safe and secure.

### GraphQL
A flexible query language for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information.

### Integration Architecture (IA)
The Integration Architecture is the overarching framework that defines how different nodes (IA node and management node), node nets, and ultimately the National Digital Twin interoperate. It lays out the principles, standards, and technical guidelines governing data sharing, security, and interoperability across all nodes and networks.

### Knowledge Graph
A graph-based data model that connects entities and relationships to enable semantic queries and insights, often used to enhance data integration and retrieval.

### National Digital Twin (NDT)
The NDT is a framework that enables the integration of information and models to solve specific problems.

### Ontology
A structured representation of knowledge within a domain, defining concepts, relationships, and categories to facilitate data interoperability and reasoning.

### RDF (Resource Description Framework)
A standard model for data interchange on the web, using triples (subject-predicate-object) to represent relationships between entities.

### SPARQL
A query language for RDF data, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate structured information stored in Resource Description Framework format.
