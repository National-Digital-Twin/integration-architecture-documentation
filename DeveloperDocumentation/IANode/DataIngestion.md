# **Data Ingestion into the Integration Architecture Node (IA Node)**

The **IA Node** components related to data ingestion include:  
- [Secure Agent Graph](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-graph) – the primary component supporting **Apache Jena Fuseki SPARQL** queries.  
- [Jena Fuseki Kafka extension module](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/jena-fuseki-kafka) – enables data ingestion from **Kafka topics**.  

For details on deploying **Secure Agent Graph** locally, refer to the [Running an IA Node Locally](../Deployment/DeploymentLocal.md) document.
