## Input
### Configuration
* ttl file to specify storage mechanism for information and how to map users to access attributes
* federator access to and from other IANodes
### Upload file
* Ability to POST a file to upload information into the IANode
* Access control in place to say which users can carry this out
### SPARQL
* Ability to POST a SPARQL formatted query to fetch data from locally held information
### GraphQL
* Ability to POST a GraphQL formatted query to fetch data from locally held information
### Kafka
* Ability to receive messages from Kafka stream for processing within the IANode

## Processing
### Validation of input
* Rules for validating incoming information from file and from message from Kafka
### Logging
* "stdout" logging of activity in the code with standard levels, debug, info, warning etc
### Federated access
* Ability to send a query to another IANode and receive response
* Ability to receive a query from another IANode and send response
* Support for sending query to multiple IANodes at once
* Support for receiving query from multiple IANodes at once
### Dataset access control
* Handling access to datasets based on attributes held in the JWT and related attribute stores
### Fine-grained access control
* Handling access at individual field level based on JWT attributes
### Mapping and transformation
* Support for mapping and transformation of the data as per the requirements
### Redaction
* Filter the data where labels don't match the user attributes
### Storage
* Standard Apache Jena in-memory storage of information
* Standard Apache Jena persistent storage called "TDB2" use local file store

## Output
### RDF (for SPARQL queries)
* Responses to SPARQL queries are in RDF format
* Support for pagination
### JSON (for GraphQL queries)
* Responses to GraphQL queries are in JSON format
* Support for pagination
### Kafka
* Ability to send out information in response to a query (??) as a message in a Kafka stream
