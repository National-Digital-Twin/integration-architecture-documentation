## Outlines the concept of an Integrated Architecture Node (IA Node). 
An AI Node is a single or minimal integration architecture node that is capable of supporting other AI nodes. It lays out the principles and standards governing data sharing, security, and interoperability across all nodes and networks.

[Integration Architecture Overview](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/integration-architecture.md) will give you a quick summary of IA node and wider networks.
