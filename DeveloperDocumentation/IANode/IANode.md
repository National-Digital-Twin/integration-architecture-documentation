# IANode
An IANode is a single, functional unit within the [Integration Architecture](../IntegrationArchitecture.md). Each IANode implements the IAâ€™s principles and standards, enabling seamless exchange of data and services with other nodes. IANodes can vary in function but share the same foundational protocols and interfaces.
