# Data Extraction Components
## Outlines the component involved with data extraction from IA Node.

The **IA Node** components involved with data extraction are:  
- [Secure Agent Graph](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-graph) â€“ This is the primary component supporting **Apache Jena Fuseki SPARQL**, **GraphQL**, and **Apache Jena Tuple Database (TDB)** queries which are the 3 [data extraction methods](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/data-extraction-methods.md#data-extraction-methods) used by IA Node.  

> For details on deploying **Secure Agent Graph** locally, refer to the [Running an IA Node Locally](../Deployment/DeploymentLocal.md).
