The **IA Node** components involved with data extraction are:  
- [Secure Agent Graph](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-graph) – This is the primary component supporting **Apache Jena Fuseki SPARQL**, **GraphQL**, and **Apache Jena Tuple Database (TDB)** queries which are the 3 [data extraction methods](./data-extraction-methods.md#data-extraction-methods) used by IA Node.  

> For details on deploying **Secure Agent Graph** locally, refer to the [Running an IA Node Locally](../Deployment/deployment-local.md).
