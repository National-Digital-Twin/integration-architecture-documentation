|            [jwt-servlet-auth](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/jwt-servlet-auth)| This repository contains a set of libraries that allows the addition of JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer authentication into Java Servlet applications.               | -     |        |
|            [label-builder](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/label-builder)| This repository contains supports for adding labels for ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) use on RDF (Resource Description Framework) data via a REST API.               | -     |        |
|            [label-builder-service](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/label-builder-service)| This repository contains a web service for adding a 'security label' to knowledge model for ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) purposes.               | label-builder-service integrates with label-builder to allow wrapping a model in a rest-api.   |        |
|            [node-lib](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/node-lib)| This repository contains helper libraries for building adaptors, mappers and projectors.               | -     |        |
|            [rdf-abac](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/rdf-abac)| This repository contains the codebase that provides the mechanism for fine-grained ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) to RDF (Resource Description Framework) data as a plug-in for use by secure-agent-graph.             | -     |        |
|            [rdf-abac-evaluator](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/rdf-abac-evaluator)| This repository contains the codebase that provides a REST service encompassing the RDF (Resource Description Framework) ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) label evaluation service.              | The evaluator calls the Access Service to retrieve user and hierarchy information, which is cached in an age-off manner. It then makes use of the 'rdf-abac evaluator' to establish whether the given request evaluates to true or false.    |        |
|            [rdf-libraries](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/rdf-libraries)| This repository contains the codebase for libraries that provides 3 services -   Catalog service, Ontology service, and RDF service.              | **1. Catalog service:** Support for working with DCAT data. **2. Ontology service:** Support for working with RDF ontologies and includes CRUD abilities and functions to help navigate an ontology hierarchy. **3. RDF service:** A helper library that abstracts away the complexity of interacting with RDF triplestores and provides CRUD abilities     |        |
|            [secure-agent-entity-resolution](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-entity-resolution)| This repository contains codebase that supports the management and analysis of data that links related records, removes duplication and highlights similar entities.             | This agent helps to pair and link records in the dataset with real-world things such as people, organisations and addresses with the aim of increasing accuracy and reliability.     |        |
|            [secure-agent-graph](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-graph)| This repository contains the codebase that provides the libraries and mechanism for receiving and holding RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. It also provides SPARQL access and integration points such as with ABAC components for security and control over data access.               | It makes use of Apache Jena and includes support for integration with Kafka. These are libraries for building Secure Agent implementations in Java. It also contains an API for defining pipelines as well as admin oriented APIs for invoking and running pipelines and API servers.    |        |
|            [secure-agents-lib](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agents-lib)| This repository contains libraries intended for rapid Secure Agents implementations in Java.               | It provides a lightweight functional API for defining pipelines as well as more admin/operations oriented APIs for invoking and running Secure Agents pipelines and API Servers.      |        |
