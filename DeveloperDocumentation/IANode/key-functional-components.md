IA Node accepts SPARQL and GraphQL queries as well as actions and data via Kafka. It provides a Json response to GraphQL queries and RDF for SPARQL queries. IA Node also integrates with an OAuth handler to provide fine-grained access control to information within it or connected IA nodes. Additionally, IA Node stores data and supports sharing of data with other IA Nodes.

## Key Functional components of an IA Node

IA Node comprises several components built on top of Apache Jena.
