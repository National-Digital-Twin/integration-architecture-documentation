## Testing coverage
Testing of the source code covers the [IA Node capabilities](IANode/IANode.md#capabilities) and the following level of scale:

* File upload into an IA Node
* Maximum file size of 20MB
* Load time of under 1 minute (with some level of mapping included TBD)
* Kafka messages
* Maximum of 10,000 initial load
* Messages processed at up to 10 per second (with some level of mapping included TBD)
* Message body size of up to 100KB
* Query (SPARQL and GraphQL)
* Maximum of 3 knowledge bases accessed by one query
* Result set of 100 items and up to 10MB in total
* Results returned within 1 minute for local node knowledge (with some level of fine-grained control and some level of redaction in place TBD)
* Multiple nodes
* One IA Node receiving data from up to 10 other nodes and sending out to up to 10 other nodes (with fine-grained access controls in use TBD)
* Results available within 30 minutes for knowledge collected from up to 10 other nodes (with some level of mapping and complexity TBD)
