# Management Node
# Outlines the concept and role of a Management Node
A Management Node is a specialised type of [IANode](IANode/ia-node.md) responsible for overseeing and managing one or more [Node nets](node-net.md). The ManagementNode ensures that the Node Net remains compliant with IA (Integration Architecture) principles, handles registration of participating IA nodes, and orchestrates updates. Crucially, it also connects to the wider national network to receive sector-agnostic updates, while allowing each Node net to apply local configurations and updates independently.
