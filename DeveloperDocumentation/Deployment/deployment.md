## Outlines the deployment options for an IA node.

You can deploy and configure an IA node across various environments including locally or to a cloud platform. The options for building and deploying an IA node include:

- [Deploying IA Node locally](deployment-local.md)
- [Deploying to an AWS EC2 Instance](deployment-aws.md#deploying-to-a-ec2-instance) - See [AWS development environment configuration](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/terraform-dev-environment-overview.md) including the [AWS Development playbook](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/terraform-dev-playbook.md) and [how to test an AWS integration](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/aws-integration-testing/blob/main/README.md#aws-integration-testing)
- [Deploying to Kubernetes in AWS](deployment-aws.md#deploying-to-kubernetes)
- [Deploying to Azure](deployment-azure.md)

Although much of the detailed documentation currently focuses on AWS, additional documentation covering other cloud providers will be added soon.
