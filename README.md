# IANode
IANode (Integration Architecture Node), is an open-source digital component developed as part of the National Digital Twin Programme (NDTP) to support managing and sharing information across organisations by pairing the physical real world objects or assets with a digital representation. The objective is to build a robust and sustainable digital twin ecosystem.  

## Getting Started
Getting Started will guide you through the different repositories and the process of integrating, configuring and using an IANode. It will help you with understanding and getting started with spinning up your own IA node. 

Before planning and starting your own IA node, you should:  

- Read about the [background](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/IANode-Background.md), [introduction](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Context.md), and [overview](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Components.md) on IANode.
- Get to know and understand the different [repositories associated with IANode](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Repositories.md).
- Understand [how data is ingesting into an IA node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/DataIngestion.md#data-ingestion-into-the-integration-architecture-node-ia-node) and [data ingestion approaches](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/DataIngestion.md#data-ingestion-methods).
- Understand [how data is exchanged between IA nodes](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/federator/blob/main/README.md#introduction).
- Understand the concept of [Producer and Consumer servers](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/federator/blob/main/docs/new-client-server.md).
- Understand [how to extract data from an IA node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/DataExtraction.md) and the [data extractor app](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/data-extractor/blob/main/README.md#data-extractor).
- Understand [how to build and deploy an IA node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/Deployment/Deployment.md#deployment).
- Understand [how to deploy an IA node to AWS](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/introduction.md#introduction) and the [AWS Development playbook](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/aws-dev-playbook.md).
- Understand the IANode Platform [Integration Architecture](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/README.md#integration-architecture).
- Reference the [IANode glossary](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Glossary.md#glossary) to understand terms, abbreviations and definitions relating to IANode.
- Know where to get help with the [AINode community forum]() if you have any questions.
