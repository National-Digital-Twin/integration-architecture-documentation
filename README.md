# What is IA Node?
IA Node (Integration Architecture Node), is an open-source digital component developed as part of the National Digital Twin Programme (NDTP) to support managing and sharing information across organisations by pairing the physical real world objects or assets with a digital representation. The objective is to build a robust and sustainable digital twin ecosystem.  

## Getting Started
Getting Started will guide you through the different repositories and the process of integrating, configuring and using an IA Node. It will help you with understanding and getting started with spinning up your own IA node. 

Before planning and starting your own IA node, you should:  

- Read about [background](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/IANode-Background.md), [introduction](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Context.md), and [overview](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Components.md) on IA Node.
- Get to know and understand the different [repositories associated with IA Node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Repositories.md).
- Understand [how data is ingesting into an IA node](../DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/DataIngestion.md).
- Understand [how data is exchanged between IA nodes](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/federator/blob/main/README.md#introduction).
- Understand the [concept of Producer and Consumer servers](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/federator/blob/main/README.md#overview-of-approach-to-ia-nodes-exchanging-data)
- Understand [how to configure a new Producer and Consumer server](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/federator/blob/main/docs/new-client-server.md).
- Understand [how to extract data from an IA node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/DataExtraction.md) and the [data extractor app](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/data-extractor/blob/main/README.md#data-extractor).
- Understand [how to build and deploy an IA node](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/Deployment/Deployment.md#deployment) and [Run a basic test](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/Deployment/DeploymentLocal.md#run-basic-test-for-minimal-ianode-functionality).
- Understand [how to deploy an IA node to AWS](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/terraform-dev-environment-overview.md) and the [AWS Development playbook](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/CloudPlatform/AWS/docs/terraform-dev-playbook.md).
- Understand [how to test an AWS integration](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/aws-integration-testing/blob/main/README.md#aws-integration-testing).
- Understand the [IA Node Platform Integration Architecture](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture/blob/main/README.md#integration-architecture).
- Reference the [IA Node glossary](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/integration-architecture-documentation/blob/main/DeveloperDocumentation/IANode/Glossary.md#glossary) to understand terms, abbreviations and definitions relating to IANode.
- Know where to get help with the [AI Node community forum]() if you have any questions.
